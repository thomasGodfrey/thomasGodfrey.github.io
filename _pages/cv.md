Education
======
* Ms.c. in Computer Science, King's College London, 2019

Work experience
======
* Summer 2017, Summer 2018: Software Research
  * King's College London
  * In 2017, I was a part of a group developing the first-pass of an agent-based simulation of ED processes from a set of interviews, background research and meetings with hospital staff. \n
In 2018, I then developed the simulation into an extensible framework called 'SimEngine' to allow for further ED simulations to be built â€“ including for future student projects. I was involved in collaborative design and development of the model from fieldwork reports and meetings with a hospital doctor. I was involved in the development of the simulation platform, the human-focused interfaces to the ABM, and collaborating on simulation-code generation for the framework using Sirius modelling.
  * Supervisors: Dr. Simon Miles and Dr. Steffen Zschaler
